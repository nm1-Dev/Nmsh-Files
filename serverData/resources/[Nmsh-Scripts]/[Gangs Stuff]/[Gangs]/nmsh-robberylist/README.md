i saw this https://forum.cfx.re/t/paid-qbcore-dongle-npc-check-robberies-darkmarket-nopixel-inspired/4859948 where people charged $25 + for a simple resource like this.

I do not plan on maintaining this if theres any PR's I will happily accept it I just hate seeing people try to scam people by making awfully easy resources and then mark it as NoPixel inspired to squeeze every single penny out of every new FiveM owner.

thats my 2 cents bye!
