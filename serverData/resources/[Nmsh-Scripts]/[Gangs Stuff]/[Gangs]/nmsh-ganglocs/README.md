# BOII | DEVELOPMENT - UTILITY: GANG LOCATIONS

Here we have a really simple script to add target locations for gangs within your city.
You can add locations for stashes, management and wardrobes to as many locations as required easily through config.
Stashes can be raided by a list of service jobs found in config.
Enjoy :)

### INSTALL

1) Customise `config.lua` & `language.lua` to your liking
2) Drag and drop `nmsh-ganglocs` into your server resources
3) Add `ensure nmsh-ganglocs` into your server cfg
4) Open F8 and type: `refresh; ensure nmsh-ganglocs` or restart your server
